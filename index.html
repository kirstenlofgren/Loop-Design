		<h2>Client Description</h2>

		<h2>System Name</h2>

		<p>I chose the name Loop for my design system because I felt it embodied the vibe my design system will have. I looked at the names of other design systems and found that the names generally fell into two categories. Names where either something related to a foundational structure for the system or the cohesion of the different elements of the system. With this in mind, I searched for a name that reflected the social nature of my company best, one that felt cohesive. I also wanted my name to reflect a fresh and friendly tone on Confectionarium. I also wanted the name to feel relaxed and stylish so I searched for a short name that I thought reflected those feelings. I think that the name Loop expresses that the brand is simple, inclusive, and fresh.</p>
