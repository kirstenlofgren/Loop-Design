				<h3 class="card-heading">Hank Fredlington</h3>
				<p>Hank always loved baking, but he didn’t know the best tools or techniques, so he created his own recipe: A cup of creativity, a dash of community spirit, and a liberal glaze of can-do attitude, and Confectionarium was born.</p>
				<blockquote>“It’s all about the open and sharing spirit that is so essential to the baking community.” -Hank Fredlington</blockquote>
